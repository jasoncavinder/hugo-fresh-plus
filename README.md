**Fresh** is a theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator adapted from the gorgeous, [Bulma](https://bulma.io)-based theme of the same name from [CSS Ninja](https://cssninja.io/freebies/fresh). You can find a live demo of the original theme [here](https://cssninjastudio.github.io/fresh) and a live demo of the Hugo theme [here](https://hugo-fresh.vercel.app).
